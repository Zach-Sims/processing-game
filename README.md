***Today you will be collaborating with your team to create a game in Processing with a custom Arduino controller.  You must use AT LEAST two sensors in your Arduino controller, they may be of the same type (two pressure sensors for example)***  

***We will play each other's games Monday afternoon at 1pm***
<br /> <br /> <br />
Here is how you get started:
  1.  Find your team in the file called ***teamAssignments.md:*** http://bit.ly/1Mcc1cH
  2.  Select a team leader
  3.  Pick a team name

Ask the team leader to do this quickly before you do anything else:
  1.  Fork the repository: https://github.com/inventioneering/processing-game
  2.  Add your teammates as collaborators to your forked repository
  3.  Create a folder named after your team.
  4.  Create a pull request so I can pull your team folder back into the master     <br /><br /> 
 ***NOTE*** Do all your work within your team folder.


Now that your team leader is done with this task do the following:
  1.  Clone your team leader's repository to your desktop app
  2.  Review ALL revisions of the file: mouseInputExploration.pde  I started with a basic example sketch and changed lots of stuff to make it behave more like I wanted it to.  My changes were incremental and I tried to explain each step a long the way.  I think it will be helpful.
  3.  Plan the game you want to build and split up the work.  EACH TEAM MEMBER IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE CODE AND COMMENTS THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT.
